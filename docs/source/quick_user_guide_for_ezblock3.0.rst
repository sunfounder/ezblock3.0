Quick User Guide for Ezblock 3.0
=====================================

About Ezblock 3
----------------------

The biggest optimization of Ezblock App upgrade from Ezblock 2 to Ezblock 3 is to modify the communication method, v2.0 uses **Bluetooth communication**, Ezblock 3 uses **Websocket communication**, which is network communication.

Ezblock 3's network communication speed will be much faster than Ezblock 2; for the Ezblock 3 version, we have also optimized and improved the connection process and almost all interfaces to make the APP more smooth and easy to use.

The Ezblock 3 version should be used with the Ezblock 3 image (`Ezblock Studio Download Center <https://ezblock.cc/download/index.html>`_.). The v3.0 version is currently in the public test stage. 

If there is a problem during use, please send an email to us, and we will test it several times to ensure that there is no problem in use.
